               LINEARITY VGA

This pattern shows 5 circles, that are matched
to the 1:1 PAR (Pixel Aspect Ratio).

The linearity of the display or upscaler can be 
verified by measuring the diameter of the circles.
Of course the linearity should be kept in all 
directions.

A grid is also available with the #GX#G and #GY#G 
buttons.
