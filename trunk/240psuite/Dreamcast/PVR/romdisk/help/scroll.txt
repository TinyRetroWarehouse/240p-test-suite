                    SCROLL TEST

This test shows a two layer background from #YSonic
the Hedgehog#Y or a single one from #YKiki Kaikai#Y.
The speed can be varied with the d-pad, and
direction changed with the button #GX#G.

Vertical and horizntal patterns can be swapped with
the #GY#G button, and #GA#G stops the scroll.

This can be used to notice any drops in framerate
when using a video processor.
