                   WARNING

The #CNintendo 64#C system can not display the full
320x240 information drawn into the frame buffer.

As a result, several pixels are never shown on
screen. This is completely normal, and official
games have this same behaviour.

As such it is recommended you don't use these
tests for multi console setups, but they work
perfectly fine for Nintendo 64.

#YCut pixels are:#Y
  Top:  1 pixel   Bottom: 3 pixels
  Left: 3 pixels  Right:  4 pixels
