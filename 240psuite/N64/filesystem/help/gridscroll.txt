                 GRID SCROLL TEST

A grid is scrolled vertically, horizontally and
diagonally which can be used to test linearity of
the displayor video processor; and how it copes
with scrolling and framerate.

Button #GCR#G can be used to switch between horizontal
and vertical, while the d-pad regulates speed. 

Diagonal scroll can be enabled with the #GR#G button.

Button #GA#G stops the scroll and button #GCL#G changes
direction.
