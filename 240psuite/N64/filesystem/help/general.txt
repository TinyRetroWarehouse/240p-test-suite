                    HELP (1/2)

The 240p Test Suite was designed with two goals
in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal processing on modern TV
sets and video processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns generated on your
game console to help in properly calibrating the
display's black, white and color levels.

Help and options are available everywhere by 
pressing the #CStart#C button.

This version of the suite supports 240p, 288p, 
576i and 480i video modes.

The #YNintendo 64#Y cuts out a few pixels on
all sides of the screen. Affected patterns show
a warning screen regarding this issue.

PAL modes must be enabled from the options menu,
but they only 480 visible lines due to the system.
