                       GRID

These grid tests change horizontal resolution
between 256, 320, 352, and 512. You can vary the
vertical resolution from the options menu. The
pattern should fill the 4:3 screen area.

You can use it to verify the visible area is being
displayed, and to check for distortion. Consumer
TVs may not show the red squares due to overscan.

The Grids are not perfectly centered within the
NTSC signal, and that is normal. It is the way
Hudson/NEC used each resolution.

- You can press button I to fill all the video
signal background area.

- The 352x240 resolution used by R-Type can be
selected by pressing up while in the 320 grid.
